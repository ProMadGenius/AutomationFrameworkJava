2. Go to Windows ✅
3. Go to Search✅
4. Search for "Xbox" and click on \"Comprar\"✅
5. Once in the result page you will see \"Aplicaciones\" click on it✅\
6. Count the elements on the first 3 pages and print the sum of elements
and all the titles✅
7. Go back to the first page and select the first NON-FREE option and
STORE the price for later comparison✅
8. If you see a \"Registration\" pop up, close it ✅
9. In this page, you will see the price again, compare first price vs
current prince and they should match✅
10. Click on the \"3 dot\" button next to \"Comprar\" button and add the

11. Verify the app takes you to the Shopping Cart page and verify you
have one element available ✅

**Acceptance criteria:**

-   Use a JSON file for the data driven approach in TC1 (I used XML for
    some data like the URL)

-   Use Page Factory and POM ✅

-   Use TestNG or Junit for Java \| Use NUnit for C\# / .NET ✅ Java

-   Use Encapsulation and Inheritance to have a more orderly design ✅

-   Research about Single Responsibility principle and apply it. In this
    case I suggest having dividing methods and elements into different
    classes ✅

-   Apply a naming convention ✅

-   Use an abstract class and an Interface (I need some refactoring, I
    did not have enough time to do it, and yeah it's easy)
